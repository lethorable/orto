# Matrix of interior orientation
# For most modern digital photogrammetric cameras this has been calibrated to be 
# symmetric. IL1 and IL2 will have [IL1= pixelsize 0] and [IL2= 0 -pixelsize]. Pixel-
# sizes are in units mm
# IL3 can be calculated as [IL3 = -(imagewidth/2) (imageheight/2)] in units mm.

# Offset to the IL3 above (a PPS/PPA offset) can be applied with XDH= and YDH=
# Most modern cameras have been calibrated to zero

# Lens distortion can be input in two ways. Either as a 7 degree polynomium or
# as a table. Most modern cameras have been calibrated to avoid this.

# Use either...:

# or... DSI, DSD and DST ... All of the three mentioned must be present

# DSI= number of entries in lens distortion table
# DSD= Distance between entries
# DST= Values for distortion (+/-). There must be 0 to DSI entries
